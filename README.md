## Commands
There are two commands:
### `/ping add`
This command brings you through a form that allows you to set up pings for multiple channels.
### `/ping remove`
This command generates dropdowns that allows you to remove pings you have already set.
# Early Development
This bot is in **early development**, and there are a **lot** of things I need to refine. For now, feel free to use this bot as-is, as it is still functional.

If you have any issues with the bot, please create an [issue](https://github.com/Erallie/voicely-ping/issues), and I will try to get to it as soon as I can!
