# Voicely Ping
Voicely Ping is a discord bot that allows users to set up direct message notifications for when there are a certain number of people in a voice channel.

## Commands
There are two commands:
### `/ping add`
This command brings you through a form that allows you to set up pings for multiple channels.
### `/ping remove`
This command generates dropdowns that allow you to remove pings you have already set.
## How Pings Work
When the number of people you specified are in one of the voice channels you specified, you will receive a **direct message** telling you who or how many people *(if more than five)* are in the voice channel.

Unless you set up more than one ping for it, you will not receive another notification until **everyone has left** the voice channel, after which the message you received will be **edited** to reflect that.
